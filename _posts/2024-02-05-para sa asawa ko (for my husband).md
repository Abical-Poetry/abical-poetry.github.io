Para sa Asawa Ko (For My Husband)

AVA, AVA. 
And the list that he brought. Budget cuts, everything.
Jouez avec ça-
He always tries to fix me. Alors.
Men communicate to achieve something. Free, more.
Often, when there is a source-
He Won't Look at Me When I'm Talking.
To answer before listening- that is folly and shame. 

Amazing wife! Supporting, encouraging, and-
PROVERBS 18:13 NIV 10.
Things a Husband Needs from 又.
Beautiful intention. I try to reassure my husband we will be okay. We would be-
Okay.

I want to be an amazing wife.
En catastrophe. WE BETTER CALL THE HOUSE TOMORROW!
Instead. I bite my tongue. We will be okay. We would be okay.
C’est facile! Para sa asawa ko. Araw araw. I would do anything for you.
Pour moi, the stakes are higher. I tend to look at only what I want. 
I want to be that. Voice of Manoah’s wife.

Can you be the voice of encouragement?
I want to be that confident voice.
The band is ordinary. Women are bad. Her presence. 
David, who is destroying Nabal and his house. Up on
Abigail’s arrival. A retourner à la maison-

She finds her husband. Intoxicated.
Abigail a attendu à la matin. Elle a dit à Nabal-
Il a offert à dire à David. Up on
Hearing the news. Nabal turned white. Ghastly white. Ghostly.
White. His heart dies- in ten days.


Why do you wear that jacket on the T?
Why do you lay in bed, David? With that jacket. That you wore. On the T, Nabal?
Abigail. Widow. She knows her best choice- chance is to marry. She
Knows. She is an amazing woman of God. He is an amazing man of God.

Les deux mariés. Il y a deux fils. Daniel et qui? Il y a deux fils.
Transform Your husband. WOMAN! She. is an amazing woman
Of God. 
Mahal kita. Para sa asawa ko. Pour mon mari. 

Just. Channel love into jobs. 
Hale wanderlust into- families?
Link to spare children.
Rear children citizens. Turn
Hunters into fathers.
Dive into male willpower. Love to
Create. I love to create.

All of my money is in your account.
I can’t trust.
Myself. Wo-men. We win.
Help strangle- stand in the mind of a woman.
Any thoughts? Empty headed woman.

This isn’t the case for all couples.
Often women- 
Often women are able to connect with emotions
More easily. C’est facile!
Even when men. MEN. are in touch with their emotions
They have difficulty expressing, GOD!

God. We had our porn- pose in moments of creation. 
Poise in moments of creation. Our beautiful differences.
What is inside of me, is outside of you.
You inside of me.
C’est l’appelle de vide. La vide. Ma vide.

Abigail was courageous. When you pressed her.
Under pressure. I can’t breathe anymore.
She had others. Yet-
To protect. Yes.
She chose to protect her husband, regardless.
Within her house. Within her womb.

Embracing du feminin. C’est facile. Les femmes. Les filles.
Aren’t women just so easy? Under pressure-
You press her. You pressed her against you.
Gamin au gamin. S'il vous plaît-
Jouez avec ça. Jouez avec moi. Comme des garçons avant toi.
Comme des garçons après toi. But not like a husband.

They have been trained from a young age
This culture- hi, baby.
My baby. I choose to protect you araw araw.
Tous les jours. Tous les joues. Mon joie. Très jolie. Très belle.
Abigail was courageous under pressure. Yes. She chose to protect her husband.

This culture. Often we fear being soft or effeminate, men, man.
After speaking à les couples- I swore I’ve seen you before-
Enfer. In fear des homosexuelles. Of the queer.
Après avoir parlé à mes couples- que feminin. We are in fear. Underneath the sheets.
Aradichave found the mail. Usually able to express her feelings more freely-
Although, more freely. We also receive les messages culturel.  
I fell in love with a war. Aucune personne ne m'a dit que c'était fini.

So I fell in love with a man. Apres ca, dans les archives. I found MORE
Free, effeminate. I found more of you. Mon mari. 
Able to express his feelings. C’est une décision pour toi, mon amour. Enfer.

Hormonal woman- able to express her feelings more freely than she was told to.
It’s- There’s nothing to be PROUD of in this century.
It’s a semi automatic. We are in a SCHOOL. Leave him-her-him alone.
Let them be soft. Effeminate. Comme les filles. Comme the field. Silent at night.
Les choix tu fait a la champ. Secret. Silent. Comme elle.

Ses choix- a result of being too dramatique ou hormonale.
I search to have an opportunity to have hands
Around his neck. Asawa ko. Mes garçons- a soft touch.

I was strangled. Under pressure. Up on. Up in 
Mes champs. My fields 
Are empty. Barren.
Give me permission to have hands

Safely around your neck, mon mari.
Safely. Hands around me. Si mon mari dit oui.
